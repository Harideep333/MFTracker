********* Project Summary: Mutual Fund Analysis & Modeling ***********

This project analyzes a comprehensive mutual funds dataset to uncover patterns in fund performance and risk characteristics using machine learning techniques. 
The data was cleaned, preprocessed, and scaled to handle missing values and ensure consistency across financial metrics such as returns, risk ratios, expense ratios, fund size, and age.

In addition, supervised learning models were built to classify whether a fund belongs to the Equity category. 
Multiple models—Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks (MLP), Perceptron, and SVM—were evaluated using cross-validation and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
This project demonstrates strong skills in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, clustering, model evaluation, and applying machine learning to real-world financial data.
